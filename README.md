ArtProject
==========

> For this project, we inherited a project that team Dangerous Wrench at Hack Reactor started and added new features to it. The new features we added were facebook login, using ionic to go mobile, a new like feature for paintings, a autocomplete feature when you search for a painting and added more paintings into the database via azure.
